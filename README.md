# advent-of-code-2020

So, I let myself be convinced to participate to de Advent of Code. I am starting late though. I intend to do my best to catch up, however I can't promise anything ;) 

The tasks are done in Python, as it is the language I am most comfortable with.

## Day 1
The resolution of both problems come from recognising that the solution is the one that give multiple times the same result when we compute the product between a number in the list and it's complement to 2020.

More detailed explanations are available in the Notebook ;-)

## Day 2

Somewhat not really challenging task as Python provides powerful methods to easily manage conditions on full lists. Main challenge was to parse the input file.
